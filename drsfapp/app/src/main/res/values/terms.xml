    <string name="eula_privacy_contents_script" translatable="false">ADAS ONE collects information about you when you use our mobile applications, websites, and other online products and services (collectively, the “Services”) and through other interactions and communications you have with us.  Scope and Application  This Privacy Statement (\\“Statement\") applies to persons anywhere in the world who use our apps or Services to request transportation, delivery, or other on-demand services (“Users”). This Statement does not apply to information we collect from or about drivers, couriers, partner transportation companies, or any other persons who use the ADAS ONE platform under license (collectively “Drivers”). If you interact with the Services as both a User and a Driver, the respective privacy statements apply to your different interactions.  Collection of Information  Information You Provide to Us  We collect information you provide directly to us, such as when you create or modify your account, request on-demand services, contact customer support, or otherwise communicate with us. This information may include: name, email, phone number, postal address, profile picture, payment method, items requested (for delivery services), delivery notes, and other information you choose to provide.  Information We Collect Through Your Use of Our Services  When you use our Services, we collect information about you in the following general categories:  •\tLocation Information: When you use the Services for transportation or delivery, we collect precise location data about the trip from the ADAS ONE app used by the Driver. If you permit the ADAS ONE app to access location services through the permission system used by your mobile operating system (“platform”), we may also collect the precise location of your device when the app is running in the foreground or background. We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address.  •\tContacts Information: If you permit the ADAS ONE app to access the address book on your device through the permission system used by your mobile platform, we may access and store names and contact information from your address book to facilitate social interactions through our Services and for other purposes described in this Statement or at the time of consent or collection.  •\tTransaction Information: We collect transaction details related to your use of our Services, including the type of service requested, date and time the service was provided, amount charged, distance traveled, and other related transaction details. Additionally, if someone uses your promo code, we may associate your name with that person.  •\tUsage and Preference Information: We collect information about how you and site visitors interact with our Services, preferences expressed, and settings chosen. In some cases we do this through the use of cookies, pixel tags, and similar technologies that create and maintain unique identifiers.  •\tDevice Information: We may collect information about your mobile device, including, for example, the hardware model, operating system and version, software and file names and verions, preferred language, unique device identifier, advertising identifiers, serial number, device motion information, and mobile network information.  •\tCall and SMS Data : Our Services facilitate communications between Users and Drivers. In connection with facilitating this service, we receive call data, including the date and time of the call or SMS message, the parties’ phone numbers, and the content of the SMS message.  •\tLog Information: When you interact with the Services, we collect server logs, which may include information like device IP address, access dates and times, app features or pages viewed, app crashes and other system activity, type of browser, and the third-party site or service you were using before interacting with our Services.  Important Information About Platform Permissions  Most mobile platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) have defined certain types of device data that apps cannot access without your consent. And these platforms have different permission systems for obtaining your consent. The iOS platform will alert you the first time the ADAS ONE app wants permission to access certain types of data and will let you consent (or not consent) to that request. Android devices will notify you of the permissions that the ADAS ONE app seeks before you first use the app, and your use of the app constitutes your consent. To learn about the platform-level permissions that the app seeks, please visit our new Android Permissions page. Sometimes these permissions require more explanation than the platforms themselves provide, and the permissions we request will change over time, so we’ve created these pages to serve as authoritative and up-to-date resources for our users.  Information We Collect From Other Sources  We may also receive information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Services. For example:  •\tIf you choose to link, create, or log in to your ADAS ONE account with a payment provider (e.g., Google Wallet) or social media service (e.g., Facebook), or if you engage with a separate app or website that uses our API (or whose API we use), we may receive information about you or your connections from that site or app.  •\tIf your employer uses one of our enterprise solutions, such as ADAS ONE for Business, we may receive information about you from your employer.  •\tWhen you request on demand services, our Drivers may provide us with a User rating after providing services to you.  •\tIf you also interact with our Services in another capacity, for instance as a Driver or user of other apps we provide, we may combine or associate that information with information we have collected from you in your capacity as a User or rider.  Use of Information  We may use the information we collect about you to:  •\tProvide, maintain, and improve our Services, including, for example, to facilitate payments, send receipts, provide products and services you request (and send related information), develop new features, provide customer support to Users and Drivers, develop safety features, authenticate users, and send product updates and administrative messages;  •\tPerform internal operations, including, for example, to prevent fraud and abuse of our Services; to troubleshoot software bugs and operational problems; to conduct data analysis, testing, and research; and to monitor and analyze usage and activity trends;  •\tSend or facilitate communications (i) between you and a Driver, such as estimated times of arrival (ETAs), or (ii) between you and a contact of yours at your direction in connection with your use of certain features, such as referrals, invites, split fare requests, or ETA sharing;  •\tSend you communications we think will be of interest to you, including information about products, services, promotions, news, and events of ADAS ONE and other companies, where permissible and according to local applicable laws; and to process contest, sweepstake, or other promotion entries and fulfill any related awards;  •\tPersonalize and improve the Services, including to provide or recommend features, content, social connections, referrals, and advertisements.  We may transfer the information described in this Statement to, and process and store it in, the United States and other countries, some of which may have less protective data protection laws than the region in which you reside. Where this is the case, we will take appropriate measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this Statement.  Sharing of Information  We may share the information we collect about you as described in this Statement or as described at the time of collection or sharing, including as follows:  Through Our Services  We may share your information:  •\tWith Drivers to enable them to provide the Services you request. For example, we share your name, photo (if you provide one), average User rating given by Drivers, and pickup and/or drop-off locations with Drivers;  •\tWith third parties to provide you a service you requested through a partnership or promotional offering made by a third party or us;  •\tWith the general public if you submit content in a public forum, such as blog comments, social media posts, or other features of our Services that are viewable by the general public;  •\tWith third parties with whom you choose to let us share information, for example other apps or websites that integrate with our API or Services, or those with an API or Service with which we integrate; and  •\tWith your employer (or similar entity) and any necessary third parties engaged by us or your employer (e.g., an expense management service provider), if you participate in any of our enterprise solutions such as ADAS ONE for Business.  Other Important Sharing  We may share your information:  •\tWith ADAS ONE subsidiaries and affiliated entities that provide services or conduct data processing on our behalf, or for data centralization and / or logistics purposes;  •\tWith vendors, consultants, marketing partners, and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work on our behalf;  •\tIn response to a request for information by a competent authority if we believe disclosure is in accordance with, or is otherwise required by, any applicable law, regulation, or legal process;  •\tWith law enforcement officials, government authorities, or other third parties if we believe your actions are inconsistent with our User agreements, Terms of Service, or policies, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of ADAS ONE or others;  •\tIn connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, consolidation or restructuring, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by or into another company;  •\tIf we otherwise notify you and you consent to the sharing; and  •\tIn an aggregated and/or anonymized form which cannot reasonably be used to identify you.  Social Sharing Features  The Services may integrate with social sharing features and other related tools which let you share actions you take on our Services with other apps, sites, or media, and vice versa. Your use of such features enables the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the social sharing service. Please refer to the privacy policies of those social sharing services for more information about how they handle the data you provide to or share through them.  Analytics and Advertising Services Provided by Others  We may allow others to provide audience measurement and analytics services for us, to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet, and to track and report on the performance of those advertisements. These entities may use cookies, web beacons, SDKs, and other technologies to identify your device when you visit our site and use our Services, as well as when you visit other online sites and services. For more information about these technologies and service providers, please refer to our Cookie Statement.  Your Choices  Account Information  You may correct your account information at any time by logging into your online or in-app account. If you wish to cancel your account, please email us at marketing@adasone.com. Please note that in some cases we may retain certain information about you as required by law, or for legitimate business purposes to the extent permitted by law. For instance, if you have a standing credit or debt on your account, or if we believe you have committed fraud or violated our Terms, we may seek to resolve the issue before deleting your information.  Access Rights  ADAS ONE will comply with individual’s requests regarding access, correction, and/or deletion of the personal data it stores in accordance with applicable law.  Location Information  We request permission for our app’s collection of precise location from your device per the permission system used by your mobile operating system. If you initially permit the collection of this information, you can later disable it by changing the location settings on your mobile device. However, this will limit your ability to use certain features of our Services. Additionally, disabling our app’s collection of precise location from your device will not limit our ability to collect your trip location information from a Driver\'s device nor our ability to derive approximate location from your IP address.  Contact Information  We may also seek permission for our app’s collection and syncing of contact information from your device per the permission system used by your mobile operating system. If you initially permit the collection of this information, iOS users can later disable it by changing the contacts settings on your mobile device. The Android platform does not provide such a setting.  Promotional Communications  You may opt out of receiving promotional messages from us by following the instructions in those messages. If you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional communications, such as those  about your account, about Services you have requested, or our ongoing business relations.  Cookies and Advertising  Please refer to our Cookie Statement for more information about your choices around cookies and related technologies.  Changes to the Statement  We may change this Statement from time to time. If we make significant changes in the way we treat your personal information, or to the Statement, we will provide you notice through the Services or by some other means, such as email. Your continued use of the Services after such notice constitutes your consent to the changes. We encourage you to periodically review the Statement for the latest information on our privacy practices.

In these Terms, the words \"including\" and \"include\" mean \"including, but not limited to.\"  By accessing or using the Services, you confirm your agreement to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use the Services. These Terms expressly supersede prior agreements or arrangements with you. ADAS ONE may immediately terminate these Terms or any Services with respect to you, or generally cease offering or deny access to the Services or any portion thereof, at any time for any reason.

Unless otherwise agreed by ADAS ONE in a separate written agreement with you, the Services are made available solely for your personal, noncommercial use. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN TRANSPORTATION, LOGISTICS AND/OR DELIVERY SERVICES THROUGH THE USE OF THE SERVICES DOES NOT ESTABLISH ADAS ONE AS A PROVIDER OF TRANSPORTATION, LOGISTICS OR DELIVERY SERVICES OR AS A TRANSPORTATION CARRIER.

Third Party Services and Content.  The Services may be made available or accessed in connection with third party services and content (including advertising) that ADAS ONE does not control. You acknowledge that different terms of use and privacy policies may apply to your use of such third party services and content. ADAS ONE does not endorse such third party services and content and in no event shall ADAS ONE be responsible or liable for any products or services of such third party providers. Additionally, Apple Inc., Google, Inc., Microsoft Corporation or BlackBerry Limited will be a third-party beneficiary to this contract if you access the Services using Applications developed for Apple iOS, Android, Microsoft Windows, or Blackberry-powered mobile devices, respectively. These third party beneficiaries are not parties to this contract and are not responsible for the provision or support of the Services in any manner. Your access to the Services using these devices is subject to terms set forth in the applicable third party beneficiary's terms of service.  Ownership.  The Services and all rights therein are and shall remain ADAS ONE's property or the property of ADAS ONE's licensors. Neither these Terms nor your use of the Services convey or grant to you any rights: (i) in or related to the Services except for the limited license granted above; or (ii) to use or reference in any manner ADAS ONE's company names, logos, product and service names, trademarks or services marks or those of ADAS ONE's licensors.  3. Access and Use of the Services  User Accounts.  In order to use most aspects of the Services, you must register for and maintain an active personal user Services account (\"Account\"). You must be at least 18 years of age, or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction (if different than 18), to obtain an Account.

You agree to maintain accurate, complete, and up-to-date information in your Account. Your failure to maintain accurate, complete, and up-to-date Account information, including having an invalid or expired payment method on file, may result in your inability to access or use the Services. You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your Account, and you agree to maintain the security and secrecy of your Account username and password at all times. Unless otherwise permitted by ADAS ONE in writing, you may only possess one Account.  User Requirements and Conduct.  The Service is not available for use by persons under the age of 18.

ADAS ONE may, in its sole discretion, create referral and/or promotional codes (\"Promo Codes\") that may be redeemed for discounts on future Services and/or a Third Party Provider's services, or other features or benefits related to the Services and/or a Third Party Provider's services, subject to any additional terms that ADAS ONE establishes. You agree that Promo Codes: (i) must be used for the intended audience and purpose, and in a lawful manner; (ii) may not be duplicated, sold or transferred in any manner, or made available to the general public (whether posted to a public form or otherwise), unless expressly permitted by ADAS ONE; (iii) may be disabled by ADAS ONE at any time for any reason without liability to ADAS ONE; (iv) may only be used pursuant to the specific terms that ADAS ONE establishes for such Promo Code; (v) are not valid for cash; and (vi) may expire prior to your use.

User Provided Content.  ADAS ONE may, in ADAS ONE's sole discretion, permit you from time to time to submit, upload, publish or otherwise make available to ADAS ONE through the Services textual, audio, and/or visual content and information, including commentary and feedback related to the Services, initiation of support requests, and submission of entries for competitions and promotions (\"User Content\"). Any User Content provided by you remains your property. However, by providing User Content to ADAS ONE, you grant ADAS ONE a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense, to use, copy, modify, create derivative works of, distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, and otherwise exploit in any manner such User Content in all formats and distribution channels now known or hereafter devised (including in connection with the Services and ADAS ONE's business and on third-party sites and services), without further notice to or consent from you, and without the requirement of payment to you or any other person or entity.  You represent and warrant that: (i) you either are the sole and exclusive owner of all User Content or you have all rights, licenses, consents and releases necessary to grant ADAS ONE the license to the User Content as set forth above; and (ii) neither the User Content, nor your submission, uploading, publishing or otherwise making available of such User Content, nor ADAS ONE's use of the User Content as permitted herein will infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party's intellectual property or proprietary rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation.  You agree to not provide User Content that is defamatory, libelous, hateful, violent, obscene, pornographic, unlawful, or otherwise offensive, as determined by ADAS ONE in its sole discretion, whether or not such material may be protected by law. ADAS ONE may, but shall not be obligated to, review, monitor, or remove User Content, at ADAS ONE's sole discretion and at any time and for any reason, without notice to you.  Network Access and Devices.  You are responsible for obtaining the data network access necessary to use the Services. Your mobile network's data and messaging rates and fees may apply if you access or use the Services from your device. You are responsible for acquiring and updating compatible hardware or devices necessary to access and use the Services and Applications and any updates thereto. ADAS ONE does not guarantee that the Services, or any portion thereof, will function on any particular hardware or devices. In addition, the Services may be subject to malfunctions and delays inherent in the use of the Internet and electronic communications.  4. Payment  You understand that use of the Services may result in charges to you for the services or goods you receive (\"Charges\"). ADAS ONE will receive and/or enable your payment of the applicable Charges for services or goods obtained through your use of the Services. Charges will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required by law. Charges may include other applicable fees, tolls, and/or surcharges including a booking fee, municipal tolls, airport surcharges or processing fees for split payments.  All Charges and payments will be enabled by ADAS ONE using the preferred payment method designated in your Account, after which you will receive a receipt by email. If your primary Account payment method is determined to be expired, invalid or otherwise not able to be charged, you agree that ADAS ONE may use a secondary payment method in your Account, if available. Charges paid by you are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by ADAS ONE.  As between you and ADAS ONE, ADAS ONE reserves the right to establish, remove and/or revise Charges for any or all services or goods obtained through the use of the Services at any time in ADAS ONE's sole discretion. Further, you acknowledge and agree that Charges applicable in certain geographical areas may increase substantially during times of high demand. ADAS ONE will use reasonable efforts to inform you of Charges that may apply, provided that you will be responsible for Charges incurred under your Account regardless of your awareness of such Charges or the amounts thereof. ADAS ONE may from time to time provide certain users with promotional offers and discounts that may result in different amounts charged for the same or similar services or goods obtained through the use of the Services, and you agree that such promotional offers and discounts, unless also made available to you, shall have no bearing on your use of the Services or the Charges applied to you. You may elect to cancel your request for Services at any time prior to the commencement of such Services, in which case you may be charged a cancellation fee on a Third Party Provider’s behalf. After you have received services or goods obtained through the Service, you will have the opportunity to rate your experience and leave additional feedback. ADAS ONE may use the proceeds of any Charges for any purpose, subject to any payment obligations it has agreed to with any Third Party Providers or other third parties.  In certain cases, with respect to Third Party Providers, Charges you incur will be owed directly to Third Party Providers, and ADAS ONE will collect payment of those charges from you, on the Third Party Provider’s behalf as their limited payment collection agent, and payment of the Charges shall be considered the same as payment made directly by you to the Third Party Provider. In such cases, you retain the right to request lower Charges from a Third Party Provider for services or goods received by you from such Third Party Provider at the time you receive such services or goods, and Charges you incur will be owed to the Third Party Provider. ADAS ONE will respond accordingly to any request from a Third Party Provider to modify the Charges for a particular service or good. This payment structure is intended to fully compensate a Third Party Provider, if applicable, for the services or goods obtained in connection with your use of the Services. In all other cases, Charges you incur will be owed and paid directly to ADAS ONE or its affiliates, where ADAS ONE is solely liable for any obligations to Third Party Providers. In such cases, you retain the right to request lower Charges from ADAS ONE for services or goods received by you from a Third Party Provider at the time you receive such services or goods, and ADAS ONE will respond accordingly to any request from you to modify the Charges for a particular service or good. Except with respect to taxicab transportation services requested through the Application, ADAS ONE does not designate any portion of your payment as a tip or gratuity to a Third Party Provider. Any representation by ADAS ONE (on ADAS ONE's website, in the Application, or in ADAS ONE's marketing materials) to the effect that tipping is \"voluntary,\" \"not required,\" and/or \"included\" in the payments you make for services or goods provided is not intended to suggest that ADAS ONE provides any additional amounts, beyond those described above, to a Third Party Provider you may use. You understand and agree that, while you are free to provide additional payment as a gratuity to any Third Party Provider who provides you with services or goods obtained through the Service, you are under no obligation to do so. Gratuities are voluntary.  Repair or Cleaning Fees.  You shall be responsible for the cost of repair for damage to, or necessary cleaning of, vehicles and property resulting from use of the Services under your Account in excess of normal \"wear and tear\" damages and necessary cleaning (\"Repair or Cleaning\"). In the event that a Repair or Cleaning request is verified by ADAS ONE in ADAS ONE's reasonable discretion, ADAS ONE reserves the right to facilitate payment for the reasonable cost of such Repair or Cleaning using your payment method designated in your Account. Such amounts will be transferred by ADAS ONE to a Third Party Provider, if applicable, and are non-refundable.  5. Disclaimers; Limitation of Liability; Indemnity.  DISCLAIMER.  THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND \"AS AVAILABLE.\" ADAS ONE DISCLAIMS ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, NOT EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THESE TERMS, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. IN ADDITION, ADAS ONE MAKES NO REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR GUARANTEE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY, TIMELINESS, QUALITY, SUITABILITY, OR AVAILABILITY OF THE SERVICES OR ANY SERVICES OR GOODS REQUESTED THROUGH THE USE OF THE SERVICES, OR THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE. ADAS ONE DOES NOT GUARANTEE THE QUALITY, SUITABILITY, SAFETY OR ABILITY OF THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS. YOU AGREE THAT THE ENTIRE RISK ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, AND ANY SERVICE OR GOOD REQUESTED IN CONNECTION THEREWITH, REMAINS SOLELY WITH YOU, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  ADAS ONE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA, PERSONAL INJURY, OR PROPERTY DAMAGE RELATED TO, IN CONNECTION WITH, OR OTHERWISE RESULTING FROM ANY USE OF THE SERVICES, REGARDLESS OF THE NEGLIGENCE (EITHER ACTIVE, AFFIRMATIVE, SOLE, OR CONCURRENT) OF ADAS ONE, EVEN IF ADAS ONE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  ADAS ONE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, LIABILITY OR LOSSES ARISING OUT OF: (i) YOUR USE OF OR RELIANCE ON THE SERVICES OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES; OR (ii) ANY TRANSACTION OR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND ANY THIRD PARTY PROVIDER, EVEN IF ADAS ONE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. ADAS ONE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR DELAY OR FAILURE IN PERFORMANCE RESULTING FROM CAUSES BEYOND ADAS ONE'S REASONABLE CONTROL. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS PROVIDING TRANSPORTATION SERVICES REQUESTED THROUGH SOME REQUEST PRODUCTS MAY OFFER RIDESHARING OR PEER-TO-PEER TRANSPORTATION SERVICES AND MAY NOT BE PROFESSIONALLY LICENSED OR PERMITTED.  THE SERVICES MAY BE USED BY YOU TO REQUEST AND SCHEDULE TRANSPORTATION, GOODS, OR LOGISTICS SERVICES WITH THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS, BUT YOU AGREE THAT ADAS ONE HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY TO YOU RELATED TO ANY TRANSPORTATION, GOODS OR LOGISTICS SERVICES PROVIDED TO YOU BY THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THESE TERMS.  THE LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMER IN THIS SECTION DO NOT PURPORT TO LIMIT LIABILITY OR ALTER YOUR RIGHTS AS A CONSUMER THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW. BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF OR THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, IN SUCH STATES OR JURISDICTIONS, ADAS ONE’S LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. THIS PROVISION SHALL HAVE NO EFFECT ON ADAS ONE’S CHOICE OF LAW PROVISION SET FORTH BELOW.  Indemnity.  You agree to indemnify and hold ADAS ONE and its affiliates and their officers, directors, employees, and agents harmless from any and all claims, demands, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys' fees), arising out of or in connection with: (i) your use of the Services or services or goods obtained through your use of the Services; (ii) your breach or violation of any of these Terms; (iii) ADAS ONE's use of your User Content; or (iv) your violation of the rights of any third party, including Third Party Providers.  6. Other Provisions  Notice.
